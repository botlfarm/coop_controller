# coop_lights

Still in progress

Intention is to coltrol a chicken coop light to increses egg production. 

Materials:
Arduino Mega 2560
ds1307 RTC
4 Channel DC 5V Relay Module

This will get current sunrise and sun set times based on date and coordinate location (location is hard prograed in code)

all menus and display controlled through serial port

you can set open and close times of the door (offset from sunrise and sunset)
you can control amount of artificial light and it will calculate when to turn the lights on and off
